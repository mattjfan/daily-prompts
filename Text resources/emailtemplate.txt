Hey,

I'm launching a website on Thursday which provides users with a 7 day challenge intended to improve their writing skills. We initially split users into three types of writing: creative, opinionated, and professional. We then provide a daily prompt, and a platform for users to write, share (if they choose), and expolore other pieces. 

I thought the ________ class you are teaching this semester was especially relevant because of our _________ track. I was hoping you would be willing to introduce your students to the website after we launch (maybe incentivize them with extra credit?). I figured getting in touch before launch was a good idea regardless, to gauge your interest in the matter.

I look forward to hearing back, feel free to ask any questions!
