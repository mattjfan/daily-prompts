Hey,

I'm Ibrahim, a student at UMD. With a couple friends, I'm launching a website on Thursday (writedaily.co) which provides users with a 7 day challenge intended to improve their writing skills. We initially split users into three types of writing: creative, opinionated, and professional. We then provide a daily prompt, and a platform for users to write, share (if they choose), and explore other pieces. 

I thought the ________ class you are teaching this semester was especially relevant because of our _________ track. I was hoping you would be willing to introduce your students to the website after we launch (would be super awesome if you incentivized them with extra credit!). I figured getting in touch before launch was a good idea regardless, to gauge your interest in the matter. 

I included a prewritten message aimed at your students below for you to use (unless you would rather write a message yourself, or not send them an email at all). It includes the extra credit bit, so go ahead and remove that if it is not something you are comfortable with doing. 

I look forward to hearing back, feel free to ask any questions!

Some UMD students built out writedaily.co, where you write responses to 7 prompts daily over the course of the week. The goal is to improve your writing through the act of writing, reading other writers' responses to the same prompts, and discussion. 

There is extra credit available for students who furnish proof of completing the 7 day challenge!
